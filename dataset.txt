REPORTDESCRIPTION: In identifying the presence of possible Hezbollah members in the Charlotte NC area, the name Rifai Qasim, has recently surfaced. An Egyptian passport in the name of Rifai Qasim was found recently on the floor of the Southern Trailways bus depot in Charlotte, NC. Examined by the Charlotte police, the picture on this passport matches the appearance of a person using the name Omar Blakely, who was charged with the theft, on 1 October, 2003, of several items [total value: $3000] from an electronics supply store in Charlotte. Blakely gave his address as: 3131 Western Ave. in Charlotte. Blakely is now out on bail that was guaranteed by a bail bond company named BailOut, in Charlotte, NC. The $2,000 that this bond cost was paid by a check written on an account at the Carolina First Bank held jointly in the names: Omar Blakely and Muhammed Mustafa. Bank records reveal periodic deposits to this account, usually in the amount of $3000, from an account at the First Emirate Bank in Dubai, UAE. The Carolina First Bank account in the name of Blakely and Mustafa was closed on 23 October, 2003 and the house at 3131 Western Ave is now unoccupied.

REPORTDESCRIPTION: Ahmed Doha and Abu Ayyash are both registered as graduate students at the University of Missouri in Columbia, MO. Both Doha and Ayyash have Saudi student visas issued in July, 2001.  Doha was charged with filing a fraudulent insurance claim. On 10 October, 2003 Doha filed a claim with Ayyash's insurance company, Central Farmers Auto Insurance Co., for a back injury he said he suffered on 12 September, 2003 when his car was struck from behind by one driven by Ayyash. Doha's insurance company is the Mid States Insurance Company. Both the Mid States and Central Farmers representatives who subsequently investigated the accident and who handled this claim both stated that Doha and Ayyash said they did not know each other. Doha was paid $11,000 in settlement of this claim on 1 November, 2003 by Central Farmer's Insurance Company. A check of the records at Mid States and Central Farmers insurance companies reveals that both Doha and Ayyash paid for their auto insurance policies from the same account at the Columbia First State Bank. On a valid search warrant, Doha's apartment at 231 12th St. in Columbia was searched on 20 November, 2003 and it was discovered that Ayyash also lives in this apartment. A Dell laptop computer at this residence was taken by the police. Also taken were CDs containing a 7,000 page version of the Encyclopedia of Jihad. The computer, when examined, revealed e-mail messages to and from over 100 addresses in the USA. Many of these messages seemed to involve only personal and academic matters. But one message that attracted attention was sent on 3 November, 2003 to an AOL address for a person identified as wshakur. This message read: "4,000 you requested sent by wire today." This e-mail address belongs to Wali Shakur, who lives at 224 Paulson Ave. in Clifton, NJ. Both Hamas and Al Qaeda are known to have a presence in Columbia, MO. An investigation continues regarding the possible association of Doha and Ayyash with these groups.

They are both wanted by the police in Buenos Aires for their role in the bombing of a Jewish synagogue in Buenos Aires in April of 2002. Escaping apprehension, they went to Calamar, Columbia in May, 2002,  where they are now known to have been active in collaborating with the ELN. In January, 2003 they came to the USA following a route taken by other Islamic militants known to have come into the USA. This route took them from Calamar to Cartagena in Columbia and then by boat to Guane in Cuba. They then went by boat from Guane, Cuba to Chetumal, Mexico. From Chetumal they traveled to Mexico City and then on to the border town of Ojinaga, where they were smuggled into Presidio, Texas. In Ojinaga they were both supplied with Texas driver's licenses and U.S. currency by a person whose name they said they could not remember. They went by bus to Ft.

REPORTDESCRIPTION: The bail bond company BailOut in Charlotte NC forfeited the $10,000 bail bond it guaranteed for Rifai Qasim [alias Omar Blakely] in connection with the theft charge against him [see FBI Report 25 October, 2003]. When this bail bond company's investigators failed to locate Qasim/Blakely after four weeks, they turned the matter over to the FBI. Qasim and his associate Muhammed Mustafa closed their joint bank account at the Carolina First Bank on 23 October, 2003 and fled in a 1997 Toyota Tercel, NC license # TQE-732. A 1997 Toyota Tercel bearing this license number was found abandoned in River Rouge Park in Detroit, MI on 15 December, 2003. Overlooked in the initial examination of this vehicle by Detroit police, but later found by FBI investigators, was a slip of paper with a phone number on it. The phone number is listed in the name Abdul al Nami, who resides at 562 Fenkell Ave. in Detroit, MI. Acting on information obtained in DIA Report 5 March, 2004, a court-sanctioned tap was placed on this phone. On 15 May, 2004 a call was placed from this phone to a residence at 237 Hayes Ave in Detroit. The caller said: "Rifai, we are all together now. We will let you know when the match will be played. It might take some time to get the right field." The person receiving the call says: "I hope it will not be too long, my side is really ready to play." Investigators went to the residence at 237 Hayes Ave. on 20 May, 2004 and found it to be unoccupied. Neighbors said that the two Middle Eastern men who had occupied this residence briefly had moved out just a few days earlier. The owner of this residence, a Mr. Howard Clark, said he had evicted the two men because they failed to pay their rent for two months. Clark did not know where they went.

REPORTDESCRIPTION: Information was requested of Belgian intelligence by the FBI on 1 September about Pieter Dopple, who lives at 22 Hoveniersstraat, Antwerp, Belgium. He sent the diamonds to Adnan Hijazi as noted in the USCBP report of 12 July, 2004. Belgian intelligence reports that Dopple has been under surveillance as a fence for diamonds obtained by groups, many of them associated with Islamic ventures, in various places in Africa. It appears that Dopple receives raw diamonds and other precious stones such as tanzanite and cuts and polishes them for distribution. Dopple receives a fee for his services but does not sell the stones himself. He sends them where his suppliers specify. At his interrogation, Dopple admitted that he was part of a scheme for transferring funds for militant Islamic groups and agreed to cooperate with investigators. He listed several persons in addition to Hijazi to whom he had sent polished diamonds and tanzanite. One person he named was Ramundo Ortiz, who runs a business in Panama City, Panama. He further said that he had just sent about $150,000 in polished diamonds to Ortiz on 25 September. Asked for the identity of the person(s) who had requested this transaction, he could only say that they were from Peshawar in Pakistan.

REPORTDESCRIPTION: On 29 October, 2004 investigators went to the offices of the American Islamic Scholarship Fund located at 1721 Glade Dr. in Reston VA. There they interviewed the director of this fund, a man named Abdul Karim. Karim led the initial discussion and described how many deserving students of Islamic descent had been assisted by this scholarship fund since it was begun in 1991. Karim was first asked if this Fund did indeed receive the $48,000 scholarship donation made by a man named Adnan Hijazi on 14 September, 2004. Checking his records, Karim verified the receipt of this donation by Karim. Then Karim was asked for the names of persons who received money from this donation from Hijazi. Karim hesitated at first and then said: "Every now and then we receive money from donors who identify the students to whom the scholarship money should go. This happened in the case of Hijazi's donation." Checking his records again, Karim said: "HIjazi stipulated that $8,000 should go to each one of the following students: Wali Shakur, 224 Paulson Ave. CLifton, NJ; Hamza al Midhar, 1641 Pitkin Ave. Brooklyn, NY; Mounir Mzoudi, 2116 27th St. Laurel, MD; Mamoun Zammar, 1621 Charles Ave., Potomac, MD; Said Khadr, 6132 Broward Blvd., Fort Lauderdale, FL; Muhammed Dandani, 455 11th St., Miami Beach, FL." Karim then said that these amounts of money were sent to each of these persons on 17 September, 2004. Finally, Karim was asked if Hijazi had made any other donations to this fund in the past.  Karim said that his recollection was that Hijazi had contributed to the scholarship fund on two other occasions, once in 1999 and once in 2001.

REPORTDESCRIPTION: A number of bombings were attempted in Casablanca on 16 May, 2003. Of five attempts only one succeeded in causing mass casualties. In four of the attempts that failed only the bombers were killed. These bombings are believed to have been the actions of local individuals who may have been trained by Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. A person believed to have been a participant in the successful bombing was apprehended on 18 June, 2003; his name is Mohamed Essabar. On interrogation, Essabar was asked to reveal the names of other participants, which, even under duress, he refused to do. However, when he was arrested he was carrying a note in Arabic signed by a person named A. Atmani. One person of interest having this name is Abdellah Atmani, who has been a resident of Casablanca all his life. During interviews with Atmani, it became clear that he had no part in the bombings on 16 May, 2003. However, his name was brought to our attention because Atmani works as a loading supervisor for the Holland Orange Shipping Lines that has offices and docks in Casablanca. Holland Orange ships make regular freight runs from Casablanca to a variety of locations along the east coast of the USA as well as to places in the Caribbean. Moroccan police reported that they were keeping Atmani under surveillance.

REPORTDESCRIPTION: Grigory Sizov, a former Soviet chemist who now teaches at a university in the USA, was asked what he could tell us about Boris Bugarov and his work in Cuba. Sizov said he knew Bugarov personally and had met him on a visit Sizov took to Moscow in 2002. Sizov said that Bugarov regards Castro as a buffoon but stays in Havana because he enjoys the climate and can make much more money there than in the former Soviet Union. Sizov also said that Bugarov showed him a picture of an attractive Cuban woman whom Bugarov said he planned to marry. Sizov said that Bugarov told him almost nothing about his work in Cuba. However, he said he was free to travel and had some very capable assistants who helped him with all sorts of things. Sizov said he guessed that Bugarov might still be involved in BW work but might also be involved in the distribution of narcotics. Finally, Sizov said he could not help noticing the several flashy diamond rings Bugarov was wearing when they met.

REPORTDESCRIPTION: In the CIA Report for 13 February, 2004 it was noted that Pakistani intelligence had agreed to keep a residence at 631 Nishtar Rd. in Karachi under surveillance. On 17 September, 2004 they reported to us that events had prompted a raid on this residence on 5 September, 2004. During this raid five persons were killed, among them two police officers. The three others killed were identified as: Abdul Jabarah [a Kuwaiti], Fahd Jehani [a Saudi], and Ramzi al Shibh [a Yemeni], all of whom are known members of Al Qaeda. Jehani seems to have been a courier since he was carrying a packet of messages. Most of the messages contained instructions for insurgent activities in Pakistan, including an attempt to be made on 1 October, 2004 to destroy police HQ in Karachi. But one message was addressed to S. H in Chitral that read; "Allah, all praise to him, has provided the funds you need to finish your work. These funds will be on their way in ten days." This message was sent by a person only identified as Moataz [possibly an alias] and was sent from Gwadar, Pakistan.

REPORTDESCRIPTION: On 3 August, 2004 two men were apprehended at the Longhorn Motel in Carrizo Springs, TX. The motel owner, Mike Sanders, said he became suspicious of the two because of the identification they presented when they registered at his motel on 2 August, 2004. One of the men presented a Texas driver's license having a picture that seemed fuzzy. In addition, they listed a Texas car license as KHZ - 116. Sanders allowed the men to stay but made note of the address on the driver's license: 2233 Fannin St. in Uvalde, TX. Sanders informed the USCBP office in Laredo who verified that there is no such address in Uvalde, TX. In addition, there was no car in the motel's parking lot having the license plate KHZ - 116. When interviewed by USCPB officers, one of the men said their car had obviously been stolen from the motel's parking lot. Most probably, the two men had crossed the border in the vicinity of Piedras Negras and Eagle Pass. They were held for questioning. Examination of their luggage revealed several documents written in Arabic, that included instructions about how to make sarin gas and ricin.
